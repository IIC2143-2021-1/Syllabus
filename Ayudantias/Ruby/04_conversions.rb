# Define arbitrary strings that LOOK like integers
three = "3"
five = "5"

# Naive addition (returns the string concatenation)
naive = three + five

# Adds the integers after getting them from the strings
real = three.to_i + five.to_i  # Returns an integer

# Adds the floats after getting them from the strings
overkill = three.to_f + five.to_f  # Returns a float

# Log results
puts naive
puts real
puts overkill
